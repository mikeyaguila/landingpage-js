# Landingpage-js
Simple HTML &amp; CSS dynamic landing page with Vanilla JS. This project required to build a multi-section landing page, with dynamically updating navigational menu based on the content that is added to the page. When a user clicks a navigation item, it should do a smooth scroll to that specific anchor section. I have also provided a smooth scroll-to-top button as you scroll further down the page.

* Languages used for this project:

  - Javascript
  - HTML5
  - CSS
